1. PaddingImage: This class is responsible to padded the given image with white pixels, in order to convert
the image to be with width and height from power of 2. The class has a private method getClosesPowerOf2 that
is charge to calculate the closet power of 2 for a given number. The class also has a constructor that is
charge to pad the image with white pixels and a public method getPaddingImage that returns the padded image.
The constructor uses Image class methods: getWidth, getHeight, getPixel. This class has a composition
relationship with Image class.
SubImages: This class is responsible for dividing a given image into smaller sub-images based on the
specified resolution. The class has a constructor, a public method setSubImage that divides the image into
sub-images based on the specified resolution, a public method getSubImages that returns 2D array of sub-images
created by setSubImage, a public method calculateBrightnessImage that computes the brightness
of a given image using a formula and returns the normalize brightness value. The class also has a private
method extractSubImage that is a helper function used by setSubImage to extract a specific sub-image from the
original image based on the row and column indices. This class has a composition relationship with Image
class.
SubImgCharMatcher: This class is responsible for matching the char with the closet brightness to a given
sub-image brightness. The class has a constructor that initiate a default round method, charset and HashMap
for brightness cache, and also calls to initiate method.
The class has private methods: initializeBrightnessMap that add to a map of the brightness values for the char
set, find the minimum and maximum brightness values and create brightness map; updateBrightnessMap that do
the same, just been called every time the char set is changing; createBrightnessMap create HashMap where
keys are the chars and values are their brightness value; getCachedBrightness if the brightness value
already been saved this function returns the saved value, otherwise calculate it using getBrightness;
getBrightness calculate the brightness value of a char; calculateRoundVal returns the char's brightness
 according to the round method.
Also has public methods: getCharByImageBrightness returns the character that is closet to a given brightness
value; addChar add char to the charset and calls updateBrightnessMap; removeChar removes char from the
charset and calls updateBrightnessMap. addChar and removeChar have been called from the Shell; getCharset
returns the charset; setRoundSubMatcher change the round method and has been called from the Shell.
The Shell class creates an instance of this class and supply it to the AsciiArtAlgorithm.
AsciiArtAlgorithm: This class implements the logic for generating ASCII art from an image. It accepts an
input image, a resolution, a character set, and a rounding method to determine the best ASCII representation
 of the image. Using the SubImages class, it divides the image into smaller sub-images based on the
resolution, calculates the brightness of each sub-image, and maps it to the closest character in the given
character set using the SubImgCharMatcher. The resulting ASCII art is represented as a 2D array of characters.
Shell: This class acts as the user interface for the program, handling input commands and orchestrating
the ASCII art generation process. It supports commands to modify the character set, adjust the resolution,
change the rounding method, and choose the output format. The class uses the AsciiArtAlgorithm to generate
ASCII art and outputs it through either a ConsoleAsciiOutput or HtmlAsciiOutput object. The shell validates
input commands and handles exceptions for invalid inputs.
2. SubImgCharMatcher:
We choose to implement the charset with a Treeset for its natural ordering and efficient O(logn) time
complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. Its sorted structure ensures easy access
to the smallest or first character.
We choose to implement the charBrightnessMap and brightnessCache with a hashMap, because this data structure
enables to save a char and his brightness value together and because the lookup, insertion and deletion
time complexity is O(1).
3. We used Java exception handling mechanism in the Shell class. The run method processes user input by
 invoking various functions that handle specific requests. Initially, the method attempts
 to create an Image object, and if an exception occurs it is caught and handled appropriately. Additionally,
 several helper functions throw exceptions when user input is invalid or an operation is not possible.
 These exceptions are caught in the run method, which then handles them by displaying relevant error messages
 to the user, preventing the program from crashing and allowing for a better user experience.
 In addition we added an exception: OutOfImagesSizeException in order to handle the case when the user want
 to change the image resolution out of image's size limitations.
4. We added two extra functions to SubImgCharMatcher class:
getCharset: The charset is managed within the run method in the Shell class, which is responsible for adding
or removing characters. The runAlgorithmAscii function, however, doesn't receive any data about the charset,
but it is responsible for throwing an exception if the given charset is too small. We decided that providing
the charset through SubImgCharMatcher doesn't break encapsulation, as it enables the function to handle
exceptions effectively.
setRoundSubMatcher: The rounding method is used to find the character with the closest brightness value for
a given sub-image. However, since the rounding method can be changed by the user in the Shell class,
we added this function to allow the Shell class to update the rounding method dynamically.
